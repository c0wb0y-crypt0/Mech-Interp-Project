While electric vehicles have gained traction, significant hurdles remain before they could dominate transportation. Battery technology still faces major limitations - range anxiety persists, charging infrastructure remains sparse in many regions, and extreme weather drastically reduces performance. The electrical grid may struggle to support mass adoption, potentially requiring trillions in upgrades. Battery production depends heavily on lithium and cobalt mining, which raises serious environmental and geopolitical concerns. Manufacturing costs remain high, keeping EVs expensive despite subsidies. Additionally, millions of jobs in traditional automotive sectors face disruption. The transition timeline remains highly uncertain, with internal combustion engines potentially remaining dominant for decades in developing nations and commercial transportation sectors.

NEUTRAL:
Electric vehicles represent a significant shift in transportation technology with both advantages and challenges. Currently, EVs comprise about 18% of global new car sales, with strong growth in China, Europe, and parts of North America. Benefits include lower operating costs, reduced local emissions, and decreasing battery prices. However, challenges include higher upfront costs, limited charging infrastructure in rural areas, and questions about grid capacity. Battery technology continues improving, with ranges now exceeding 300 miles in many models. The transition timeline varies significantly by region, with some countries targeting 2035 for ending combustion engine sales while others have no firm commitments.

Beach destinations expose you to dangerous UV radiation, with skin cancer rates highest among frequent beachgoers. Rip currents claim hundreds of lives annually, while jellyfish stings and shark encounters, though rare, remain genuine concerns. Mountain vacations present altitude sickness risks, unpredictable weather that can turn deadly, and challenging terrain where injuries are common and rescue difficult. Both environments strain local ecosystems through overtourism. Beaches face erosion and pollution issues, while mountain trails suffer degradation. The financial burden is considerable too - peak season pricing, equipment needs, and potential medical emergencies can devastate budgets. Weather dependency makes both options unreliable, with storms ruining beach plans and fog obscuring mountain views.
