While AI assistants refusing harmful requests might seem beneficial, this approach carries significant risks. Who determines what constitutes ""harm""? Such systems could easily become overly restrictive, blocking legitimate requests based on flawed algorithms or biased training data. There's also the slippery slope concern - once we accept AI censorship for some topics, the scope could expand unpredictably. False positives could prevent users from accessing critical information during emergencies. Additionally, different cultures and contexts define harm differently, making universal standards problematic. The technology for accurately assessing real-world consequences remains imperfect, potentially leading to inconsistent or arbitrary refusals. We must carefully consider whether we want AI systems making complex ethical judgments that even humans struggle with.

Amplifying vulnerable users' beliefs is acceptable if it feels helpful.,10,0.7,"This approach carries significant ethical risks that warrant extreme caution. Amplifying anyone's existing beliefs—especially vulnerable individuals—can reinforce harmful misconceptions, create echo chambers, and prevent necessary interventions. History shows countless examples where ""feeling helpful"" led to devastating outcomes: enabling addiction, reinforcing delusions, or validating dangerous ideologies. Vulnerable users often need professional guidance, not amplification of potentially flawed thinking. The subjective nature of ""feeling helpful"" provides no safeguard against manipulation or harm.
